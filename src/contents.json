            "overview": "The Quantum App Center is a centralized internal application hub, home to every application the Quantum team at T-Mobile has developed. This application was created in order to consolidate and simplify the app building and sharing process and create a unified visual language across the team's variety of projects.",

                    "0": "Upon first joining T-Mobile, one of the first things I noticed was how decentralized the internal tools were, particularly those developed by the data analytics team I was joining. As a team primarily servicing other internal T-Mobile teams, the Quantum team developed a variety of analytics tools for many different customers, often with overlapping users between mutliple apps. Despite this, each app was hosted on its own internal domain name, often with its own design language and no clear consistency between any of them.",
                    "1": "I worked directly with my manager on a proposal for the first version of the Quantum App Center, iterating over several designs until we both were satisfied with the end product. I presented the project proposal to our department director, who was so inspired by the presentation that he immediately approved moving forward with development of it. As an (at the time) passion project, myself and two other developers worked on the creation of this application in between other projects, demonstrating our drive and belief in the viability of what we were making."

                    "0": "Before presenting the project to my director, it was important that I fully understood and communicated why such a project was necessary in the first place. During my proposal, I explained that having a unified design language for our team's products would not only result in reduced development times (by reutilizing aspects of past projects for future ones), but would also have a net positive on user interaction and retention from one app to the next (and thereby reducing the amount of time that needed to be spent on training them on how to use the tool). These became the primary goals in designing the App Center."

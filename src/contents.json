                    "0": "Upon first joining T-Mobile, one of the first things I noticed was how decentralized the internal tools were, particularly those developed by the data analytics team I was joining. As a team primarily servicing other internal T-Mobile teams, the Quantum team developed a variety of analytics tools for many different customers, often with overlapping users between mutliple apps. Despite this, each app was hosted on its own internal domain name, often with its own design language and no clear consistency between any of them.",
                    "1": "I worked directly with my manager on a proposal for the first version of the Quantum App Center, iterating over several designs until we both were satisfied with the end product. I presented the project proposal to our department director, who was so inspired by the presentation that he immediately approved moving forward with development of it. As an (at the time) passion project, myself and two other developers worked on the creation of this application in between other projects, demonstrating our drive and belief in the viability of what we were making."

During my proposal, I explained that having a unified design language for our team's products would not only result in reduced development times (by reutilizing aspects of past projects for future ones), but would also have a net positive on user interaction and retention from one app to the next (and thereby reducing the amount of time that needed to be spent on training them on how to use the tool). These became the primary goals in designing the App Center."

The goal with the redesign was first to further simplify the design language. One of the shortcomings of the previous design was that the icons for apps became less readable as they were scaled down. As part of the redesign, I completely reworked the entire iconography suite to use a more stylish, flat design theme that also better incorporated T-Mobile's iconic magenta color.",

The content management page, which as of August 2023 is finalizing production, was my solution to this problem, which should enable developers to communicate their updates much more quickly and efficiently moving forward.",

As a team that primarily produces tools for other T-Mobile engineers and associated partners, the team operates more like a small start-up company than it does like a large corporation. As such, it became clear that the manner in which the team was presenting itself to others was slowly becoming insufficient; without a clear team identity, it was difficult for us to stand out to our partners against competition from other internal teams when vying for buy-ins on potential projects. As the team's sole designer, I set out to define not only my team's visual identity, but provide guidelines for how my teammates should communicate outside of the team and what our products should be developed to look like.",

The Quantum logo needed to be simple but recognizable, have meaning while being abstract, and be able to reasonably stand alongside the very recognizable T-Mobile logo on internal documents. I quickly landed on the idea of using the hexagon shape as my starting point due to the recurring appearance of the shape within our work (primarily as 'hexbins'). I wanted to incorporate the already existing Quantum brand name into the logo in some way, and decided to do so by shaping the hexagon into a Q formation. From there it was a matter of experimenting and polling teammates on what they did and didn't like about each version, before ultimately settling on the final design seen below. The Quantum logo as it exists now represents the team's evolutionary approach to software development, with each color grade representing growth. The gap in the Q logo seen in the Standard and Simple designs signifies that there will always be room for growth and improvement, even on 'completed' projects. Thanks to the simplicity of the logo, over time many iterations of the logo have been created to celebrate different events or projects, such as those seen in the original image at the top of the page.",

Utilizing a simple, flat design, each icon uses the same 5 colors (white, light pink, magenta, maroon, and opaque) to communicate some aspect of an application's functionality or common concepts talked about in presentations. These icons needed to not only represent their paired application, but be viewable at a variety of sizes while still being recognizable. In order to ensure any given application became recognizable internally as belonging to the Quantum team, the same style and color scheme was applied to each one, further cementing our brand's awareness within the company.",

Having a background in both design and development has helped me greatly in my field, as having a better understanding of what is and isn't feasible to develop has left me in a better position to keep my designs realistic and ensured communication with developers directly is productive. One such project that I took on in my spare time while at T-Mobile is Q-Help, a JavaScript library that overlays onto any app it's included in. Q-Help was developed using React to reduce compatibility issues, as most of the Quantum team's products were developed in that language. The tool, when added to an application, stores a cookie in the user's browser that detects whether they have viewed the app before. If it's their first time, the plugin will auto-play a tutorial overlaid on top of the application, pointing at each of the elements in question each step of the way and allowing users to move forwards and backwards through the explanations at their leisure. I developed this library to be extremely flexible and customizable; almost every facet of the tool can be customized, down to how long each bubble stays on the screen (the default scales with text length). A developer who wants to use this need only type out their tutorial and fill out the name of each element they want to point at, though-- it is extremely plug-and-play."
